# Biostatistics

I've been teaching this course for over 10 years now and over time learned to make the material interesting to motivate students and help them understand the subject more effectively. I've received so many positive feedbacks on the presentation and effectiveness of the discussed subjects recently, so decided to share my material publicly so everyone can benefit from them.

Biostatitics is a general education course and knowledge of the discussed subjects are very important for understanding many stat related topics. The first few chapters that deal with descriptive stat are essentil for anyone who works with data. 

If you're a student or seeker of knowledge, dive in and have fun!

If you're an instructor, feel free to use the material on your course, please don't remove my name and credential from the slides, you can add yours next to it, that's cool with me ;)

Happy Learning!
